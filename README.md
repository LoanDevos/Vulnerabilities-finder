# Vulnerabilities-finder
Python script to find vulnerabilities thanks to BOMs


Create your own sbom with the tool of your choice but make the output being in format CycloneDX. Then enter the path to the BOMs into the arguments of the functions and run the code you should get your vulnerability.


scriptv2 allows you to get the vulnerabilities from one sbom, scripttest2 allows you to compare the components and vulnerabilities found by two different BOM generation tools.

scripttest and scriptstat allows you to know your max range of queries with the OSSIndex API and how often you will get back new queries.
